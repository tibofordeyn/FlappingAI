# *Flapping AI*
<!--Intro-->
__This is my first programming project in which I will be making a clone of the flappy bird game, and an AI that will be able to play it.__

<!--MAIN INFO-->
## Current updates
At the time of writing, I just started this project. Therefore I haven't really got anything left to say right now. This file will be updated regularly throughout the projects evolution.

I am right now thinking about wether to make a moving floor which you aren't allowed to touch or not. I personally think it's uselss and ugly, however I've never seen flappy bird without a surface.

<!--HOW TO RUN THE CODE-->
## Running my program
To see what I have already written, use the git clone command to download the project:
   ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/tibofordeyn/FlappingAI.git
   ```
then run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
    $ python3 main.py
   ```

Make sure you have the adequate python version and the pygame library installed.

__Thanks for looking at my project. Have a nice day!__
